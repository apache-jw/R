# Data cleaning and visualization in R
# We will use Coffee dataset to practice

# load the dplyr package


# Import Coffee data, use your code from last exercise:



# P1: Arrange data
# What is the ProductID of the most profitable coffee?
# Write your code below:



# P2: Subset data
# Find the subset of data with Sales larger than 200
# Write your code below:



# P3: Group and Summarise data
# Find out the total profit and average inventory level of each product (identified by a unique ProductID)



# P4: Create a new variable, ProfitRatio, which equals Profit/Sales



# P5: Make histogram
# Plot the distribution of COGS
# Write your code below:


  
# P6: Make boxplot
# Plot the distribution of profit across different products
# Write your code below:



# P7: Make scatterplot
# Plot the relationship between profit margin and inventory
# Write your code below:
