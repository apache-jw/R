## Agenda

- Introduction to R and RStudio
    - Understand the interface
    - Brief introduction of R syntax and constructs
    - Import a dataset
    - Run R code
    - Install and use R packages
- Dplyr: grammar for data manipulation

## Software Tools: R and RStudio

- **R** is a statistical programming language
    - R does all the actual computational work
- **RStudio** is an _Integrated Development Environemnt_ (IDE)
    - Sits top of R, it is a graphical interface between R and you (users)
    - Makes R much more user-friendly
    - We will always work in RStudio

## RStudio Interface

## RStudio Components

1. Script Panel
    - This is where the R code is shown and edited
    - When you open a R code file, its content shows up here
2. Console Panel
    - This is where R code is executed
    - Results will show up here
    - If there is an error in your code, the error message will also show up here
3. Environment Panel
    - This is where the variables and data are displayed
    - It helps to keep track of the variables and data you have
4. Utility Panel
    - This window includes several tabs
        - Files: shows the path to your current file, not often used
        - Plots: if you use R to plot a graph, it will show up here
        - Packages: install/import packages, more on this later
        - Help: manuals and documentations to every R functions, very useful

## R Syntax and Constructs

- In its simplest form, R can be used as a calculator

```{r}


```


- Variables in R are like _placeholders_
    - They contain values we are working with

```{r}


```


- Obviously, R can do much more
    - Most of R's value comes from working with external data
- Data in R can take the forms of **vectors**, **matrices**, and **data frames**
    - We mostly work with data frames
- **Data frame** looks just like an ordinary data table or spreadsheet (as in Excel)
    - Each row is one record
    - Each column is a variable. Different columns can have different data types



- The use of **Functions** makes R very powerful
- **Functions** are defined operations performed on data
- You can either use existing functions or make functions by your self
- Each function has certain **input**, **parameters**, and **output**
    - Input is the data you want to manipulate
    - Parameters are extra conditions or specifications
    - Output is the results
- In RStudio, you can look up a function's details in the "_Help_" tab
    - E.g., let's look up the function _sort()_


```{r}
# vector

# matrix

```

## Import Data into R

- R can handle all kinds of data files. We will mostly deal with _csv_ files
    - Stands for _comma separated values_, i.e., values separated by commas
- Use **_read.csv()_** function to import csv data
    - You need to specify path to the data file
    - By default, comma is used as field delimiter. Delimiter can also be other characters (e.g., tab)
    - First row is used as variable names by default
    - The output is a dataframe

```{r, eval=FALSE}

data <- read.csv(PATH-TO-FILE)

```


Two ways to specify path to the data file

1. Specify the **full path**
    - Make sure to use "/", not "\\", between directories
```{r, eval=FALSE}
toy_data <- read.csv("data/toy data frame.csv")
```

2. **First, store data file and R script in the same location**. Then, in Rstudio, click "Session" in menu bar, go to "set working directory", select "to source file location". Finally, simply use file name as the path
```{r}
# after setting working directory to source file location

```

## Examine Data Frame

```{r}
# access the value in row 2 and column 2
toy_data[2,2]


# access the values in column "Gender"
toy_data$Gender

```


```{r}
# function "summary()" can summarize variables
summary(toy_data)

```
```

## Install and Use R Packages

- R packages are user-created programs to enhance the capability of R
- To install a package in RStudio, use the "Packages" tab in the Utility panel. Click on "Install", input the package name, then click "Install". RStudio will do the rest for you

- Or, just run ```install.packages("Package Name")```
- Let's install the package named ```dplyr```

- To use a package, you need to first load it using the _library()_ function
```{r, message=FALSE}

```
- A package only needs to be loaded once in one script


## Use R for Data Cleaning

- We will learn how to use R and ```dplyr``` to:
    - Arrange data based on one or more variables
    - Filtering data
    - Creating new variables
    - Joining two data tables
    - Grouping data by one or more variables and generate summary statistics



- We will use the following toy data frame
```{r}

```

### Arrange Data

- Use ```arrange``` function to sort the data
- ```dplyr``` package offer a nice way to writing code using the %>% sign

```{r}
# sort data by age, from young to old
toy_data %>% arrange(Age)


# sort data by age, from old to young

toy_data %>% arrange(desc(Age))

```

### Subset Data
library(tidyverse)
- Use ```filter()``` function to select subsets of data according to some rules
```{r}
# select all female persons from the data
select(toy_data$Gender == "F")


# select all male persons older than 20
select(toy_data$Gender == "M" & toy_data$Age > 20)

```
### Select Variables


- Use ```select()``` function to select certain variables
```{r}
# select gender and age

select(toy_data$Gender, toy_data$Age)

# select all variables but ID
select(toy_data, -ID)


```

### Create New Variables

- Use ```mutate()``` function to create new variables
```{r}
# create a new variable, BMI, based on height and weight
# BMI = weight (in kilograms) / height (in meters) squared
mutate(toy_data, BMI = Weight / (Height / 100) ^ 2)




```

### Join Two Data Tables

- Use ```join()``` and related function to join two tables
```{r}
join(toy_data, toy_data2, by = "ID")


```

### Group data and summarize

- Use ```group_by()``` followed by ```summarise()```
- Notice that %>% can be chained together to perform a sequence of manipulations
```{r}
# group by gender and summarize the average age, height, and weight of each group
group_by(toy_data$Gender) %>% summarise(Age = mean(Age), Height = mean(Height), Weight = mean(Weight)

```

## Use R for Visualization

- We will learn how to use R to plot:
    - Histogram
    - Boxplot
    - Scatterplot
    - Scatterplot Matrix
- We will use the Iris dataset
```{r}
iris <- read.csv("data/iris.csv")

```

###Histogram

- Use _hist()_ function to plot histogram
```{r}
hist(iris$Sepal.Length)

```

### Boxplot

- Use _boxplot()_ function to plot boxplot
```{r}


```

### Scatterplot

- Use _plot()_ function to plot scatterplot
```{r}



```

### Scatterplot Matrix

- Use _pairs()_ function to plot scatterplot matrix
```{r}


```

## Hands-on Practice

- Open "HandsOn-Data-Process.R" in Rstudio
- Finish each practice, following the steps indicated in comments

pairs(iris[,1:4], lower.panel = NULL, cp; =iris$Species)

par(xpd =T) 
legend(2.5, 8, legend = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"), col = c("red", "green", "blue"), pch = 1)
